# Assignment-2
PART #1: 
Reflection: For this assignment, we practiced using an unsupervised learning tool to visualize data. We also practiced training a simple machine-learning model to classify the quality of wines. For the first model, I used previous codes from the examples provided in class to set the title, xlabel, and ylabel for the wine quality data set. I also practiced splitting the data using a decision tree and logistic regression model for the wine quality data set to find the accuracy of each graph. Even though I followed the example given to me, it was imperative to modify the codes to fit the data that I was working with to avoid errors. Last but not least, I was able to practice training the logistic regression model and found the accuracy to be 0.96. I believe my model was successful.
